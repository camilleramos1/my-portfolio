# My Portfolio Website

## Description
This repository contains the code to my portfolio website. As I complete projects throughout the course I will be able to update this website to include future projects. 

I have included an about me section, links to projects, and a contact submission form. The site is responsive to smaller displays.

## IMPORTANT NOTE:

For the contact submission form located towards the bottom of my site, I used HTML code found on W3 Schools, the link is: https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_contact_form.asp
